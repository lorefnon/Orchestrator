          <hr><h2>Overview :</h2>
          <p>
            Orchestrator aims to be a simple extension for Backbone View class which enables you bind model attributes to content, attributes or css-rules for
            any DOM node. Binding configuration is specified in pure javascript inside View class. No custom attributes / special tags / exotic markup is required
            in the HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orchestrator does not seek to perform any kind of occult sorcery behind the scenes. While this does mean that everything is pretty much transparent and
            for cases of advanced configuration debugging is easy, it also means that no claim regarding drastic reduction of code is being made.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orchestrator is agonistic of any templating libraries and has built in support for asynchronous construction of DOM nodes. While basic use-cases can be 
            fulfilled in very few lines of code, the configuration system is flexible and can accomodate a wide variety of advanced usage scenarios.
            Asynchronous construction of DOM nodes is supported out of the box, so you can pull in your templates when necessary, create the relevant nodes and once
            done bind them to the model. Also real-time binding is supported for elements which might be added on-the-fly.
          </p>

          <hr><h2>Alternatives :</h2>
          <p>
            There are other projects which have been tackling the problem of data-binding from a variety of aspects.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your prefer to specify your binding configuration through data-attributes right inside your HTML - <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout JS</a> is worth a look.
            An integration layer for using Knockout alongside Backbone is <a href="http://kmalakoff.github.com/knockback/">available</a>. Another similar 5approach that
            is easy to integrate in any MVC setup is offered by <a href="http://rivetsjs.com">Rivets.js</a> library.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> by Google takes a much more radical and sophisticated approach towards building client side web-applications. If you do like the concept of
            supercharging HTML with capabilities beyond its original intent, this is definitely worth a try.
