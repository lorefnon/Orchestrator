Fork the\r\nproject and once you have made your changes, request for a pull. Please make\r\nsure that your changes/contributions available under the MIT license. It is\r\npreferred that your contributions would not introduce large dependencies.\r\nI plan to keep the codebase tiny, lightweight and maintainable.\r\nAlso for the sake of coherence please follow the same coding style as in\r\nBackbone source code.\r\n\r\nAlso apart from code contributions - comments, suggestions and bug-reports\r\nare welcome too. Please use the Github issue tracker for the same.\r\n\r\nAlthough I appreciate feature requests, I can not guarantee at this point how\r\nsoon they will be implemented. Also I can not fullfill requests to re-implement\r\nthe extension for some other DOM manipulation library or some other MV*\r\nframework. Apologies for the same. If you have been working on creating any\r\nsuch port, feel free to drop me a line, and I will add a reference to your work.\r\n\r\nCurrent Status :\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nUnder development - API changes are the order of the day.\r\n\r\nDocumentation :\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nUsage and manual and annotated source code will soon be available.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n","name":"Orchestrator","tagline":"An extension for Backbone View class to provide enhanced facilities for methodically managing the DOM structure and Data associations between Model and View.","google":"UA-35021844-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
