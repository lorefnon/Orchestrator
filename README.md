 - Backbone MVC micro-framework ( http://backbonejs.org/ )

Contributions :

You are welcome to contribute to the project if you like the concept. Fork the 
project and once you have made your changes, request for a pull. Please make 
sure that your changes/contributions available under the MIT license. It is 
preferred that your contributions would not introduce large dependencies. 
I plan to keep the codebase tiny, lightweight and maintainable. 
Also for the sake of coherence please follow the same coding style as in 
Backbone source code.

Also apart from code contributions - comments, suggestions and bug-reports 
are welcome too. Please use the Github issue tracker for the same.

Although I appreciate feature requests, I can not guarantee at this point how 
soon they will be implemented. Also I can not fullfill requests to re-implement 
the extension for some other DOM manipulation library or some other MV* 
framework. Apologies for the same. If you have been working on creating any 
such port, feel free to drop me a line, and I will add a reference to your work.

Current Status :

Usage and manual and annotated source code will soon be available.
